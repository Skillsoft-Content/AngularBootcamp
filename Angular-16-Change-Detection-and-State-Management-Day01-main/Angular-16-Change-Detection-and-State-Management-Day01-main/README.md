Angular is a JavaScript framework designed and developed to support front-end browser-based applications. Angular ships with a boilerplate app already built in. It is secure, robust, and reliable. Angular is open-source. It was developed by Alphabet for creating dynamic modern web apps and SPAs. Angular uses TypeScript for the supporting code and regular HTML for the front end. Development is based on Components. 

In this boot camp we focus on state management and change detection. There are several ways to store state including just creating an object in a service. However as the app grows some kind of reactive library like RxJS or ReactiveX has several benefits. In this boot camp we will demonstrate RxJS then NgRx and finally Signals to store state.
