# Angular-16-Routing-with-Services
Although Angular does not produce physical files that can be stored on a computer, it produces views. Several views can be combined into a layout or application interface. Routing therefore allow users to switch between views, pass values into views and restrict views based on some logic. Routing also supports lazy loading.


After completing this course participants will be able to:
•	Create a boilerplate Angular application
•	Add components to an existing application
•	Create views and display components.
•	Pass parameters (values) to components
•	Generate child routes
•	Restrain certain components from being loaded until needed
•	Use middleware to support lazy loaded components
